# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The prework study guide project was a lengthy but useful project. What motivated me to create this project the yearn to grow as a future web developer. I build this project because I knew it would be beneficial to keep notes about the things I learned. My project helps the user remember notes in the future so they can be prepared for what awaits them
